   C-client functions are not const correct and using them with literal strings
   results in gcc warnings about "deprecated conversion from string constant to
   char*" so use this function to suppress it. It also has the advantage of
   working with wxCharBuffer, i.e. can be used as @code CONST_CCAST(s.mb_str())
   @endcode with Unicode build of wx in which mb_str() doesn't return a char*
   directly.

   Hopefully one day c-client will be updated to work with const char strings
   making all this stuff unnecessary, removing it will be then simple as you
   could just grep for CONST_CCAST instead of examining all casts in the
