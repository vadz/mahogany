                                        *** WARNING ***

 This is the 0.66 alpha version of the Mahogany e-mail client. "Alpha" means
that many of the features which the finished product will have are still
lacking and that you may (and probably will) find bugs in it. However even in
its current state Mahogany is already very useful to us and we hope it will
also be it for you as well as to improve it much further -- with your help!

 So please send your impressions, questions, feature requests and bug reports
to our mailing list at
                             mahogany-users@lists.sourceforge.net
and help us to improve this program.

 Thanks for trying Mahogany!
