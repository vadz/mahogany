                     How to add a new option to Mahogany
                     ===================================

0. About this note
------------------

   Mahogany has a lot of options according to one of its basic design
principles: nothing should be hardcoded, everything which might be changed
must be exposed to the user as sooner or later someone will want to change it.

   You should respect this rule when adding new code to Mahogany by avoiding
any manifest constants in it - be it numbers, strings or colours. This tech
note describes how to add a new option to Mahogany and how to use it in your
code.

1. What are the options
-----------------------

   All Mahogany options correspond to the entries in the config object which
is accessed via Profile class. A config object is a wxFileConfig under Unix
which uses the $HOME/.M/config file by default or a wxRegConfig under Windows
which uses the registry hive HKCU\Software\Mahogany-Team\Mahogany. You may
directly change the options in the file/registry for testing but you should
really provide a way to modify them from the GUI - see below.

   Each option has a name and a value which is either a number (long - which
may be treated as int, bool or enum by the program) or a string. To avoid the
dependency problems (namely needing to recompile the entire program if you
add/modify just one option) the name and value are not exposed directly but
the following trick is done: for each option FOO there are

a) a line "extern const MOption MP_FOO" in include/Moptions.h
b) a line
        #define MP_FOO_NAME "NameOfOptionInConfig"
   and
        #define MP_FOO_DEFVAL 17
   in the same header
c) definition in src/classes/Moptions.cpp: "const MOption MP_FOO;"
d) and finally an entry in MOptions[]: DEFINE_OPTION(MP_FOO)

So to add a new option FOO you just have to modify 2 files in the 4 places
enumerated above. Note that the the order of options in the lists (c) and (d)
above *MUST* be the same so besure to put any new option you add at the same
(relative) position!

Also note that the zero default value for long options should be written 0L
and not just 0 as to avoid ambiguities between long and "char *" later.

2. Using the options
--------------------

   To use the option in the program you must get a Profile object somewhere.
Some options (very few) are global: use mApplication->GetProfile() to get the
global profile which should be used for accessing them. Others (most) depend
on the folder and you should use the profile of the folder you're working with
then, i.e. MFolder or MailFolder or ASMailFolder::GetProfile(). Don't forget
to call DecRef() on the profile object returned by these functions to avoid
memory leaks or, better yet, use Profile_obj class which is a smart pointer to
Profile and avoids memory leaks automatically (downside: you can't use it for
mApplication->GetProfile() because this one should _not_ be DecRef()'d).

   Now that you have a Profile (or Profile_obj) "profile" you may just do the
following:

        long myfoo = READ_CONFIG(profile, MP_FOO);

or

        bool myfoo = READ_CONFIG_BOOL(profile, MP_FOO);

or

        String myfoo = READ_CONFIG_TEXT(profile, MP_FOO);

These macros will read the value from profile and return the default value
that you defined above (in Moptions.h). To be able to use them you should
insert a

        extern const MOption MP_FOO;

somewhere in the declarations section of your file. Please do *NOT* include
Moptions.h but declare the individual options you use like this - this avoids
massive recompilations whenever you change a single option.

   Last note: you don't have to use mApplication->GetProfile(), in fact. There
is a similar set of READ_APPCONFIG(MP_FOO) macros which take just one argument
and use the global profile automatically.

3. Adding GUI support for editing the options
---------------------------------------------

   To give the user a possibility to change the programs behaviour he should
have a simpler way to change the options value than editing the config file or
running regedit.exe. This is what the options dialog is for - you should be
familiar with it by now, anyhow.

   Unless your options is very special (or you have added a lot of them) you
should add it to one of the existing pages of the dialog. Choose the one where
you'd expect to find it, please try to not put in the "Miscellaneous" page.

   The options dialog is automatically generated, in fact, from the 3 arrays
in src/gui/wxOptionsDlg.cpp. Search for DONT_FORGET_TO_MODIFY marker in this
file to find them.

   As the marker says, you must modify all of them when adding new option:

a) add a new ConfigField_Foo to ConfigFields array, to the page (and at the
   position) you want

b) add a struct to the initialization of ms_aFields _at_exactly_the_same_
   position

c) add a CONFIG_ENTRY(MP_FOO) to ms_aConfigDefaults, again at exactly the
   same relative position

It is imperative that the 3 arrays be kept in sync, some asserts will be
triggered if this is not the case - please do pay attention to them if this
happens.

   The steps (a) and (c) should be obvious, for the step (b) please look at
wxOptionsPage.h for the Field_XXX constants descriptions. The types should be
self explanatory (they simply correspond to the controls shown in the dialog),
for the flags please see the desscriptions in the comments. Finally, this
struct also has a dependency field: if it is -1, it is not used at all. If it
is positive, this field is only enabled if the field with id equal to the given
number is "on" which means being checked for a checkbox, non empty for a text
zone and so on. And if the dependency field is negative (but not -1) it is
interpreted in the "opposite" way: the field is only enabled when the field
specified by the absolute value of the dependency field is "off".


   You may want to add 2 other kinds of entries to these arrays: first, an
explanation text. For it you should do the same thing as above but use
Field_Message in the step (b) and CONFIG_NONE() for the step (c).

   Second, if you have a few related but seldomly accessed options, you may
want to write a separate dialog for editing them. In this case you should use
Field_SubDlg in (b) and again CONFIG_NONE() in (c) and also modify/add
OnButton() of/to the page class containing your entry.

4. Reacting to the options changes
----------------------------------

   If you use the options you should be also prepared to update them
(immediately!) when the user presses "Apply" or "Ok" button in the dialog
above.

   This section will be written later (TODO!) but for now please look at the
existing code in MessageView or FolderView classes, for example, which shows
how this should be done.

5. Advanced notes
-----------------

   Mahogany uses different profile paths under Unix and Windows or, to be more
precise, when using registry under Windows (which is the default) and using
config files (which is the only possibility under Unix and may be also done
under Windows). This means
that the path used in the program and the actual path in wxConfig may be
different. Normally, it shouldn't matter as Profile class takes care of it but
it will break down if you access the config directly using wxConfig. For this
reason you must use Profile::GetXXXPath() methods to retrieve the actual path
in config.
